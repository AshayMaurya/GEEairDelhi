# GEEairDelhi
Utilizing Google Earth Engine and Sentinel-5P data, this project aims to map pollution levels across Delhi.

This Earth Engine script, designed for Google Earth Engine API, assesses air quality in Delhi by analyzing satellite data for April 2019 and 2020. The code fetches, filters, and clips Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite image collections for SO2, NO2, CO, and Aerosol within Delhi's boundaries. Visualizations, utilizing color palettes, showcase pollutant concentration levels on the map, while interactive charts illustrate median values, enabling a comparative analysis of air quality trends over the specified months. This GitHub repository provides a comprehensive tool for assessing and visualizing air quality dynamics in Delhi.
